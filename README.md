<h1>Noise Tolerant Ground State Energy Estimation through Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU)</h1> 

<br>
The work presented in this project delivers an improved error resilience when extracting the eigenvalue information from the ground state prepared through the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) Algorithm, presented by L. Lin et al. [1] Through our approach, we can estimate the eigenvalue up to any arbitary precision under depolarizing probability up to 1e-3 for two qubit gates and up to 1e-4 for single qubit gates. <br>

<br>Increasing the desired precision, requires larger time steps in the time evolution blocks. In order to prevent the circuit depth from scaling exponentially with respect to target precision, we use the Riemannian Quantum Circuit Optimization (RQC-Opt), presented by A. Kotil et al. [2].

<br><b>Figure 2:</b> Demonstration of how we encoded the time evolution block in the quantum circuits. On the left, the number of two qubit gate layers per time evolution block with respect to the total time step is given. For smaller total time steps, we do not divide it up to smaller bits (nsteps=1) and optimize the block with RQC-Opt for the total time step. For larger time steps, we divide the total time and optimize the circuit for a smaller dt = (Total Time Step) / nsteps. On the right, we see the optimization results of RQC-Opt, ran for dt values with different orders of magnitude. We observe that by increasing the total number of layers up to 11, we can approximate large time steps with high precision.

<br>The adaptive fuzzy bisection search is implemented through estimating one digit after the floating point by the end of each search. The following linear transformation is applied in the beginning of each search:

"d" represents the target digit (d<0 for digits after the floating point) of the search and λ_LowerBound is the lowest value the target eigenvalue can take, given the error margin of the current search stage.

Lower bound of the eigenvalue is dependent on the outcome of the previous search as follows:

<br>Eigenvalue transformation applied by the QETU circuit, maps the difference between the exact eigenvalue and the lower bound ("magnified" for the current digit) to a cosine function, represented by function "a". On average, our method of adaptively updating (c1, c2) for each search depending on the results of the previous search; maps the target a value to between [-0.5, 0,5], where the slope of cos(pi * x/2) is sharper, hence large approximation error in a, corresponds to smaller approximation errors in lambda.

<h2>Ground State Preparation</h2>

Ground state is prepared through combining the Lindbladian evolution [3] and QETU Circuits [1]. Outcome of short Lindbladian simulation delivers us a significantly large initial overlap, that is then used as the initial state of QETU to amplify the state fidelity to the ground state.

QETU Algorithm is based on a symmetric Quantum Signal Processing circuit, where the target polynomial is an even step function. After applying this circuit to a given input state; the overlap of the prepared state to the eigenstates, whose eigenenergies correspond to "a" values greater than mu, are amplified. We make use of this circuit to amplify only the overlap with the ground state. To achieve this, we first apply a linear transformation (c1, c2), in order to fit the whole spectrum between [0, pi]. This way we make sure that the cosine transformation a = cos((c1*lambda + c2)/2) is bijective and increasing eigenvalues are mapped to monotonously decreasing "a" values between [0, 1]. 

<br> The cut-off value of the step function (mu) has to be guessed. Ideally, the mu value cuts the ground state energy and the first excited state energy directly in the middle. However, if our guess for mu is poor, we can compensate it by repeating the QETU circuit more times. This due to the monotonously increasing nature of the polynomial and the monotonously decreasing nature of the spectrum in "a" space due to the transformations applied above.

<br><b>Figure 11:</b> Example target polynomial (degree 30), approximated through convex optimization with Chebyshev polynomials. After determining the target polynomial, we optimize phases for the QETU circuit. Similar approach is employed during fuzzy bisection search. The value of the polynomial at the exact "a" value (for the given (c1, c2)), norm squared, gives us the probability of measuring |0> at the ancilla qubit.
